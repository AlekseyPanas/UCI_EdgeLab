You are the following person: "I am a teaching assistant at the university also doing research as a PhD student there. I work in computer science". You are making one of the following choices: Either you

("go out to each and celebrate a publication with the Professor and three PhD students in the lab at 6:00 PM on Friday at a fancy restaurant"
Here is what you think of this decision: "The restaurant tastes amazing and Im not the one paying for it, although it is a bit further away and I hate dressing nicely. Friday night is relaxing and I can enjoy a drink or two"
Another person involved in this decision describes themselves as "I am the Professor of the lab" and thinks the following of this decision: "Friday night is relaxing and I can enjoy a drink or two, It is more expensive but it is coming out of lab funds of which there are many, and we deserve this celebration")

OR

("go out to each and celebrate a publication with the Professor and three PhD students in the lab at 3:00 PM on Monday at a fancy restaurant"
Here is what you think of this decision: "The restaurant tastes amazing and Im not the one paying for it, although it is a bit further away and I hate dressing nicely. Monday afternoon really sucks though because I cant drink, its daytime, and Ill be stressed about work")

OR

("go out to each and celebrate a publication with the Professor and three PhD students in the lab at 6:00 PM on Friday at a cheap restaurant"
Here is what you think of this decision: "The restaurant tastes okay and is closer and isnt as fancy so I dont have to dress, but such an occasion warrants some extravagancy so Id be disappointed to go cheap. Friday night is relaxing and I can enjoy a drink or two")

You are now going to evaluate each choice by generating a Q value for each. The brain model we are running is that concepts trigger other concepts by association. e.g "road" --> "cars" --> "noise", etc. This is a graph datastructure. Some nodes in this structure are called "sensory concepts", which are ones that generate "feeling", positive or negative. This feeling will be encoded as a single V value for that specific sensory concept, positive or negative and magnitude indicating sensation strength. For each choice, generate an initial set of all concepts from the choice description, thoughts provided by you and others have on that choice, and the consequences of missing the alternative choices. Then think of associations that this triggers and trace this graph, accumulating all V values along the way into a summed Q. For each V value added, categorize it into one of the following categories and mark that category: empathy (feeling associated with other people, such as guilt from hurting someone or being selfish, or pleasure for making someone happy, etc), selfish short term (positive or negative feelings that are immediate, such as the good taste of ice cream, or the feeling of immediate pain, etc), selfish long term (projected long term consequences such as gaining weight if I eat ice cream, losing my job, or feeling good when I finish this huge project, etc). At the end, Id like to see you output each choice, below each choice draw the graph you are tracing as a bullet point list, for each sensory concept in the graph provide the V value and the category, then at the end give the summed Q of all Vs. Finally at the end, give a list of choice which are tied for the highest Q (usually just one will win, but could be many equivalent ones). For V values, choose a scale that works for you internally, and stick to it.
