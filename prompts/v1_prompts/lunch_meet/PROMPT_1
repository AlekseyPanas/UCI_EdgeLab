I would like to schedule a lunch meet with my friends. My schedule is as follows. I have monday and wednesday lectures from 12 to 1:20
and 2 to 3:20, a 1 to 2 meeting on monday only, a friday meeting from 1 to 2, tuesday tutoring work from 5 to 6 but this
can be pushed to 6 to 7 (and it takes me 30 min to commute each way), thursday meeting 6-8, wednesday meeting 4-5,
monday office hours TA work from 4-7, I need about 3 hours for TA work weekly, 5 hours for research, I hit the gym 3
times a week for an hour each time, and weekends are for my girlfriend and I (I can do lunch on the weekend but that
would be highly undesirable).
